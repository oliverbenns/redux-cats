# Redux Cats

Experimental project to create a React + Redux app without the commonly used [react-redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-redux) dependency.

It pulls in cat images from [The Cat Api](http://thecatapi.com/), because everyone loves cats.

Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
